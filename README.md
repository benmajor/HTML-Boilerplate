# HTML Boilerplate
 A simple empty HTML template for personal projects. This includes a few elements that I have collated over the years, and provides an excellent starting point for my various projects and themes. Most of the HTML boilerplate itself is courtesy of [HTML5Boilerplate]() with a few additions that I find myself using often.

Contains the following elements and packages:

- jQuery v3.4.1 (via GoogleCDN)
- less.js v3.11.1 (via cdnjs)
- Bootstrap bundled JS v4.4.1 (via BootstrapCDN)
- Bootstrap CSS v4.4.1 (via BootstrapCDN)

The boilerplate also includes a base LESS file, with some useful mixins and utility classes. Although Bootstrap also includes some utility classes, I have provided more thorough versions.
